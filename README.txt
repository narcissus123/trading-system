My contributions Overview:

I made valuable contributions to the development of various components in the trading system project. My contributions mainly focused on the front-end interface using QT, authentication implementation, and the trading strategy module. Additionally, I collaborated on generating documents such as SRS documents, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture and functionality. Moreover, I participated in integrating the front-end with the C++ back-end for seamless functionality."
